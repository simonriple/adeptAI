	"ourVisionDescription": "With AI, we have now taken the step up another division. <br /> <br /> We have now integrated AI into Adept™ through the development of the \"Adept™ AI Engine\". The solution has been developed in close collaboration with <u>Webstep</u> and is already in use by some of our customers. In short, the \"Adept AI Engine* extends the solution from being a compliance management tool to actually doing a significant part of the compliance work. The explanation for this success is that we have, with the permission of our customers, been able to develop our AI algorithm based on high-quality Adept\"™ data from many years ago. <br /><br /> The solution is therefore not only \"language model\"-based, but also largely \"knowledge\" - based.We look forward to further developing the solution in collaboration with <u>Webstep</u> and the new opportunities we know are coming.",

We benefit greatly from the tool in our compliance management against legal/regulatory requirements, standards and internal company requirements from the parent company. We use Adept Concept actively in our governance processes towards the company's head office in Stockholm.<br /><br />The functionality is user-friendly and has led to a much more distributed and more efficient compliance control involving many disciplines within the company. The functionality for the comparison between previous and new versions is unique and has attracted attention in Skanska internationally.",

Without the support that the tool provides, it would be an almost insurmountable task to find out which laws and regulations is changed or updated at any time, but through notification and monitoring as well as highlighting changes, this is now handled in an appropriate and simple way.",

We are certified according to ISO 9001 and 14001, and with Adept™ it has been a simple matter to document compliance both with requirements in ISO 9001, ISO 14001, authority requirements and customer requirements throughout this period.<br /><br />The focus on documented compliance with requirements is increasing, but we find that this is easy to accommodate, not least after Adept™ introduced the \"Update Centre\", where we can easily update our management system in the event of regulatory changes.<br /><br />Clear and attractive reports make it easy to document compliance with external parties.",

			"description": "Getting four new, state of the art, Jack-up new buildings successfully introduced to, and into operation on the Norwegian Continental Shelf, requires a very structured, solid and trustworthy AoC (Acknowledgement of Compliance) process towards and with the authorities.<br /><br />Even though an AoC process has a lot of repeated and similar activities included, it is for MDN of great importance to ensure- and provide evidence, that our verification process is of an individual and independent character. Obtaining and keeping track of compliance for +12,000 different legislation requirements in an AoC process is a huge task to overcome.<br /><br />With Adept™, being our main tool for performing both Technical-and Operational compliance verifications, we believe we have achieved both a more systematic (aligned across units), consistent (fixed methodology) and maybe most important and sustainable approach to the process and subsequent maintenance and follow up of the AoC, then we had before - This is something which all units in the MDN fleet are benefitting from today.<br /><br />Working with Adept™ is a pleasure. Always professional attendance to challenges we have faced in the process, fast support at all times and a constant vigilant and innovative approach to problem solving. No challenge seems unsolvable for Adept™ and it has been gratifying for MDN to observe and benefit from the constant attempts to improve the portfolio of services included in Adept™™.<br /><br />Both the \"Update Center\" and the GAP module for performing internal GAP analysis have created further sustainability.",
